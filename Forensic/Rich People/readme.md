## Description
You ever notice how rich guys casually mention grabbing something like a new car or another plane, if it’s just a small item they tossed into their *BIN*? They talk about these massive purchases like the rest of us talk about picking up groceries. It’s like they don’t even think twice about it—see it, like it, it’s theirs. Meanwhile, we’re out here sweating over sales and discounts, trying to stretch every dollar. Different playing field, for sure!
